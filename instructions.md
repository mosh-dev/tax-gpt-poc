I need to create a ai assisted tax submission helper that will help me generate my tax documents and help me by giving me helpful tips based on my data.

This ai tool will use locally hosted llm model in LMStudio

and for my data it will retrieve from a web api.

I want a simple conversational ui that will help me generate my tax documents. While chatting, 
it will ask different questions based on my data and may ask me to provide more information.
I can upload PDF documents, and it will extract the data from the PDF and provide me with the data.
